strong-license
==============

Simple license generator/validator using JWT with the pre-defined claim names
(fields) and validation semantics.

 * `product` - a string identifying the product the license applies to
 * `features` - an array of strings identifying features of the product
 * `activationDate` - a Date indicating when the license period starts
 * `expirationDate` - a Date indicating when the license period ends
 * `email` - a string identifing who the license is for (primarily used for
   logging and identification for support purposes)

Both the `product` and `features` fields support `*` as a wildcard to indicate
that all products or features are covered by the license. When the product
field is a wildcard, any product check matches but it does not imply that all
features are covered. When the features list contains a wildcard as one of its
entries, any feature check matches.

## Usage

The strong-license module defines the License class, which can be used for
generating, parsing, and validating a license key.

### Generating a License Key

```js
var License = require('strong-license');
var details = {
  email: 'user@example.com',
  product: 'enterprise-node',
  features: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'],
  activationDate: new Date(),
  expirationDate: new Date(Date.now() + 1000*60*60*24*365),
};
var lic = new License(details, 'super secret key!');

process.env.LICENSE_KEY = lic.key;
```

It is also possible to generate a null license, which does not cover any
products or features and is perpetually expired. It does, however, cover the
null query scenario.

```js
var License = require('strong-license');
var nullLicense = new License();

nullLicense.covers(); // => true! Can't do anything, but can do nothing!
```

### Parsing/Validating a License Key

If a license coverage query omits a field, that field is considered a match.

```js
var License = require('strong-license');
var now = new Date();
var yesterday = new Date(Date.now() - 1000*60*60*24);
var lic = new License(process.env.LICENSE_KEY, 'super secret key!');

lic.covers('enterprise-node', 'foo', now); // => true
lic.covers('myProduct', 'featurex', now); // => false
```

If a parameter is omitted, is considered a match.

```js
lic.covers('enterprise-node', 'bar', null); // => true
lic.covers('enterprise-node', null, now); // => true
lic.cocers(null, 'baz', yesterday); // => false
lic.covers(); // => true! any license covers "nothing"
```
