It does not intend to implement all the aspects formalized in the YAML \nspecs, but rather to implement a robust parser in Javascript, enough to load \nsimply structured YAML files.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe parser is available as a NPM module, this is the recommended way of installation.\n\nRun the following command and you should be ready to go:\n\n    npm install yamlparser\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nToDo\n\nDisclaimer\n----------\n\nI try to deliver high quality products, but I do not guarantee that the product\nis free from defects.
