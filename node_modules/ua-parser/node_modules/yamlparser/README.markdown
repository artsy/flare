Description
-----------

This is CommonJS port of my Javascript YAML Parser, available at:
http://code.google.com/p/javascript-yaml-parser/

The same as the original project, this project intends to implement a simple YAML 
parser. It does not intend to implement all the aspects formalized in the YAML 
specs, but rather to implement a robust parser in Javascript, enough to load 
simply structured YAML files.

Installation
------------

The parser is available as a NPM module, this is the recommended way of installation.

Run the following command and you should be ready to go:

    npm install yamlparser
