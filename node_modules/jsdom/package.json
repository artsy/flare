  "readme": "# jsdom\n\nA JavaScript implementation of the WHATWG DOM and HTML standards.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$ npm install jsdom\n```\n\nIf this gives you trouble with errors about installing Contextify, especially on Windows, see [below](#contextify).\n\n## Human contact\n\nsee: [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jsdom)\n\n## Easymode: `jsdom.env`\n\n`jsdom.env` is an API that allows you to throw a bunch of stuff at it, and it will generally do the right thing.\n\nYou can use it with a URL\n\n```js\n// Count all of the links from the Node.js build page\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\");\n\njsdom.env(\n  \"http://nodejs.org/dist/\",\n  [\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js\"],\n  function (errors, window) {\n    console.log(\"there have been\", window.$(\"a\").length, \"nodejs releases!\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\nor with raw HTML\n\n```js\n// Run some jQuery on a html fragment\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\");\n\njsdom.env(\n  '<p><a class=\"the-link\" href=\"https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom\">jsdom!</a></p>',\n  [\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js\"],\n  function (errors, window) {\n    console.log(\"contents of a.the-link:\", window.$(\"a.the-link\").text());\n  }\n);\n```\n\nor with a configuration object\n\n```js\n// Print all of the news items on Hacker News\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\");\n\njsdom.env({\n  url: \"http://news.ycombinator.com/\",\n  scripts: [\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js\"],\n  done: function (errors, window) {\n    var $ = window.$;\n    console.log(\"HN Links\");\n    $(\"td.title:not(:last) a\").each(function() {\n      console.log(\" -\", $(this).text());\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nor with raw JavaScript source\n\n```js\n// Print all of the news items on Hacker News\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\");\nvar fs = require(\"fs\");\nvar jquery = fs.readFileSync(\"./jquery.js\", \"utf-8\");\n\njsdom.env({\n  url: \"http://news.ycombinator.com/\",\n  src: [jquery],\n  done: function (errors, window) {\n    var $ = window.$;\n    console.log(\"HN Links\");\n    $(\"td.title:not(:last) a\").each(function () {\n      console.log(\" -\", $(this).text());\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThe do-what-I-mean API is used like so:\n\n```js\njsdom.env(string, [scripts], [config], callback);\n```\n\n- `string`: may be a URL, file name, or HTML fragment\n- `scripts`: a string or array of strings, containing file names or URLs that will be inserted as `<script>` tags\n- `config`: see below\n- `callback`: takes two arguments\n  - `errors`: either `null`, if nothing goes wrong, or an array of errors\n  - `window`: a brand new `window`, if there were no loading errors\n\n_Example:_\n\n```js\njsdom.env(html, function (errors, window) {\n  // free memory associated with the window\n  window.close();\n});\n```\n\nIf you would like to specify a configuration object only:\n\n```js\njsdom.env(config);\n```\n\n- `config.html`: a HTML fragment\n- `config.file`: a file which jsdom will load HTML from; the resulting window's `location.href` will be a `file://` URL.\n- `config.url`: sets the resulting window's `location.href`; if `config.html` and `config.file` are not provided, jsdom will load HTML from this URL.\n- `config.scripts`: see `scripts` above.\n- `config.src`: an array of JavaScript strings that will be evaluated against the resulting document. Similar to `scripts`, but it accepts JavaScript instead of paths/URLs.\n- `config.jar`: a custom cookie jar, if desired; see [mikeal/request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) documentation.\n- `config.level`: either `1`, `2`, `3`, or `'living'`, to restrict yourselves to features in certain DOM specifications. The default is `'living'`.\n- `config.document`:\n  - `referrer`: the new document will have this referrer.\n  - `cookie`: manually set a cookie value, e.g. `'key=value; expires=Wed, Sep 21 2011 12:00:00 GMT; path=/'`.\n  - `cookieDomain`: a cookie domain for the manually set cookie; defaults to `127.0.0.1`.\n- `config.features`: see Flexibility section below. **Note**: the default feature set for jsdom.env does _not_ include fetching remote JavaScript and executing it. This is something that you will need to _carefully_ enable yourself.\n- `config.done`, `config.loaded`, `config.created`: see below.\n\nNote that at least one of the callbacks (`done`, `loaded`, or `created`) is required, as is one of `html`, `file`, or `url`.\n\n### Initialization lifecycle\n\nIf you just want to load the document and execute it, the `done` callback shown above is the simplest. If anything goes wrong, either while loading the document and creating the window, or while executing any `<script>`s, the problem will show up in the `errors` array passed as the first argument.\n\nHowever, if you want more control over or insight into the initialization lifecycle, you'll want to use the `created` and/or `loaded` callbacks:\n\n#### `created(error, window)`\n\nThe `created` callback is called as soon as the window is created, or if that process fails. You may access all `window` properties here; however, `window.document` is not ready for use yet, as the HTML has not been parsed.\n\nThe primary use-case for `created` is to modify the window object (e.g. add new functions on built-in prototypes) before any scripts execute.\n\nYou can also set an event handler for `'load'` or other events on the window if you wish. But the `loaded` callback, below, can be more useful, since it includes script errors.\n\nIf the `error` argument is non-`null`, it will contain whatever loading error caused the window creation to fail; in that case `window` will not be passed.\n\n#### `loaded(errors, window)`\n\nThe `loaded` callback is called along with the window's `'load'` event. This means it will only be called if creation succeeds without error. Note that by the time it has called, any external resources will have been downloaded, and any `<script>`s will have finished executing.\n\nIf `errors` is non-`null`, it will contain an array of all JavaScript errors that occured during script execution. `window` will still be passed, however.\n\n#### `done(errors, window)`\n\nNow that you know about `created` and `loaded`, you can see that `done` is essentially both of them smashed together:\n\n- If window creation succeeds and no `<script>`s cause errors, then `errors` will be null, and `window` will be usable.\n- If window creation succeeds but there are script errors, then `errors` will be an array containing those errors, but `window` will still be usable.\n- If window creation fails, then `errors` will be an array containing the creation error, and `window` will not be passed.\n\n#### Migrating from before v1.0.0\n\nIf you used jsdom before v1.0.0, it only had a `done` callback, and it was kind of buggy, sometimes behaving one way, and sometimes another. Due to some excellent work by [@Sebmaster](https://github.com/Sebmaster) in [#792](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/pull/792), we fixed it up into the above lifecycle. For more information on the migration, see [the wiki](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/wiki/PR-792).\n\n#### Dealing with asynchronous script loading\n\nIf you load scripts asynchronously, e.g. with a module loader like RequireJS, none of the above hooks will really give you what you want. There's nothing, either in jsdom or in browsers, to say \"notify me after all asynchronous loads have completed.\" The solution is to use the mechanisms of the framework you are using to notify about this finishing up. E.g., with RequireJS, you could do\n\n```js\n// On the Node side:\nvar window = jsdom.jsdom(...).parentWindow;\nwindow.onModulesLoaded = function () {\n  console.log(\"ready to roll!\");\n};\n```\n\n```html\n<!-- Inside the HTML you supply to jsdom -->\n<script>\nrequirejs([\"entry-module\"], function () {\n  window.onModulesLoaded();\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nFor more details, see the discussion in [#640](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/640), especially [@matthewkastor](https://github.com/matthewkastor)'s [insightful comment](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/640#issuecomment-22216965).\n\n### On running scripts and being safe\n\nBy default, `jsdom.env` will not process and run external JavaScript, since our sandbox is not foolproof. That is, code running inside the DOM's `<script>`s can, if it tries hard enough, get access to the Node environment, and thus to your machine. If you want to (carefully!) enable running JavaScript, you can use `jsdom.jsdom`, `jsdom.jQueryify`, or modify the defaults passed to `jsdom.env`.\n\n## For the hardcore: `jsdom.jsdom`\n\nThe `jsdom.jsdom` method does less things automatically; it takes in only HTML source, and does not let you to separately supply script that it will inject and execute. It just gives you back a `document` object, with usable `document.parentWindow`, and starts asynchronously executing any `<script>`s included in the HTML source. You can listen for the `'load'` event to wait until scripts are done loading and executing, just like you would in a normal HTML page.\n\nUsage of the API generally looks like this:\n\n```js\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\").jsdom;\nvar doc = jsdom(markup, options);\nvar window = doc.parentWindow;\n```\n\n- `markup` is a HTML document to be parsed. You can also pass `undefined` to get the basic document, equivalent to what a browser will give if you open up an empty `.html` file.\n\n- `options`: see the explanation of the `config` object above.\n\n### Flexibility\n\nOne of the goals of jsdom is to be as minimal and light as possible. This section details how someone can change the behavior of `Document`s before they are created. These features are baked into the `DOMImplementation` that every `Document` has, and may be tweaked in two ways:\n\n1. When you create a new `Document`, by overriding the configuration:\n\n  ```js\n  var jsdom = require(\"jsdom\").jsdom;\n  var doc = jsdom(\"<html><body></body></html>\", {\n      features: {\n        FetchExternalResources : [\"img\"]\n      }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Do note, that this will only affect the document that is currently being created. All other documents will use the defaults specified below (see: Default Features).\n\n2. Before creating any documents, you can modify the defaults for all future documents:\n\n  ```js\n  require(\"jsdom\").defaultDocumentFeatures = {\n      FetchExternalResources: [\"script\"],\n      ProcessExternalResources: false\n  };\n  ```\n\n#### External Resources\n\nDefault features are extremely important for jsdom as they lower the configuration requirement and present developers a set of consistent default behaviors. The following sections detail the available features, their defaults, and the values that jsdom uses.\n\n`FetchExternalResources`\n\n- _Default_: `[\"script\"]`\n- _Allowed_: `[\"script\", \"img\", \"css\", \"frame\", \"iframe\", \"link\"]` or `false`\n- _Default for `jsdom.env`_: `false`\n\nEnables/disables fetching files over the file system/HTTP\n\n`ProcessExternalResources`\n\n- _Default_: `[\"script\"]`\n- _Allowed_: `[\"script\"]` or `false`\n- _Default for `jsdom.env`_: `false`\n\nEnables/disables JavaScript execution\n\n`SkipExternalResources`\n\n- _Default_: `false` (allow all)\n- _Allowed_: `/url to be skipped/` or `false`\n- _Example_: `/http:\\/\\/example.org/js/bad\\.js/`\n\nFilters resource downloading and processing to disallow those matching the given regular expression\n\n### Canvas\n\njsdom includes support for using the [canvas](https://npmjs.org/package/canvas) package to extend any `<canvas>` elements with the canvas API. To make this work, you need to include canvas as a dependency in your project, as a peer of jsdom. If jsdom can find the canvas package, it will use it, but if it's not present, then `<canvas>` elements will behave like `<div>`s.\n\n## More Examples\n\n### Creating a browser-like window object\n\n```js\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\").jsdom;\nvar document = jsdom(\"hello world\");\nvar window = document.parentWindow;\n\nconsole.log(window.document.innerHTML);\n// output: \"<html><head></head><body>hello world</body></html>\"\n\nconsole.log(window.innerWidth);\n// output: 1024\n\nconsole.log(typeof window.document.getElementsByClassName);\n// outputs: function\n```\n\n### jQueryify\n\n```js\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\");\nvar window = jsdom.jsdom().parentWindow;\n\njsdom.jQueryify(window, \"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.js\", function () {\n  window.$(\"body\").append('<div class=\"testing\">Hello World, It works</div>');\n\n  console.log(window.$(\".testing\").text());\n});\n```\n\n### Passing objects to scripts inside the page\n\n```js\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\").jsdom;\nvar window = jsdom().parentWindow;\n\nwindow.__myObject = { foo: \"bar\" };\n\nvar scriptEl = window.document.createElement(\"script\");\nscriptEl.src = \"anotherScript.js\";\nwindow.document.body.appendChild(scriptEl);\n\n// anotherScript.js will have the ability to read `window.__myObject`, even\n// though it originated in Node!\n```\n\n### Serializing a document\n\n```js\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\").jsdom;\nvar serializeDocument = require(\"jsdom\").serializeDocument;\n\nvar doc = jsdom(\"<!DOCTYPE html>hello\");\n\nserializeDocument(doc) === \"<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body>hello</body></html>\";\ndoc.documentElement.outerHTML === \"<html><head></head><body>hello</body></html>\";\n```\n\n## What Standards Does jsdom Support, Exactly?\n\nOur mission is to get something very close to a headless browser, with emphasis more on the DOM/HTML side of things than the CSS side. As such, our primary goals are supporting [The DOM Standard](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/) and [The HTML Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/). We only support some subset of these so far; in particular we have the subset covered by the outdated DOM 2 spec family down pretty well. We're slowly including more and more from the modern DOM and HTML specs, including some `Node` APIs, `querySelector(All)`, attribute semantics, the history and URL APIs, and the HTML parsing algorithm.\n\nWe also support some subset of the [CSSOM](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/), largely via [@chad3814](https://github.com/chad3814)'s excellent [cssstyle](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cssstyle) package. In general we want to make webpages run headlessly as best we can, and if there are other specs we should be incorporating, let us know.\n\n## Contextify\n\n[Contextify](https://npmjs.org/package/contextify) is a dependency of jsdom, used for running `<script>` tags within the page. In other words, it allows jsdom, which is run in Node.js, to run strings of JavaScript in an isolated environment that pretends to be a browser environment instead of a server. You can see how this is an important feature.\n\nUnfortunately, doing this kind of magic requires C++. And in Node.js, using C++ from JavaScript means using \"native modules.\" Native modules are compiled at installation time so that they work precisely for your machine; that is, you don't download a contextify binary from npm, but instead build one locally after downloading the source from npm.\n\nGetting C++ compiled within npm's installation system can be tricky, especially for Windows users. Thus, one of the most common problems with jsdom is trying to use it without the proper compilation tools installed. Here's what you need to compile Contextify, and thus to install jsdom:\n\n### Windows\n\n- The latest version of [Node.js for Windows](http://nodejs.org/download/)\n- A copy of [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop)\n- A copy of [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/), installed in the default location of `C:\\Python27`\n\nThere are some slight modifications to this that can work; for example other Visual Studio versions often work too. But it's tricky, so start with the basics!\n\n### Mac\n\n- XCode needs to be installed\n- \"Command line tools for XCode\" need to be installed\n- Launch XCode once to accept the license, etc. and ensure it's properly installed\n\n### Linux\n\nYou'll need various build tools installed, like `make`, Python 2.7, and a compiler toolchain. How to install these will be specific to your distro, if you don't already have them.\n",
